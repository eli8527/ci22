Your code is committed into repositories, where each project has its own repository. For this course, all projects and assignments will be organized into one repository. GitHub is a service that hosts a copy of your git repository online. This makes it easy for others to contribute to, and most importantly host it online as a website.
At this point your repository on your computer probably looks like this:</description></item><item><title>People</title><link>http://ci22.href.blue/people/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://ci22.href.blue/people/</guid><description>STUDENTS

Together, they form the foundation for interaction design and practice on the web.
Studio meets twice a week and will provide a thorough and elaborate study of interactive concepts and techniques for applications. We will conduct an extensive investigation into the interface, mechanism, controls, and aims of interactive works. Students will learn how to design and develop complex interactive projects, undertaking comprehensive research and directing their thinking process from brainstorming to final outcome.</description></item><item><title>Week 1</title><link>http://ci22.href.blue/schedule/week1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://ci22.href.blue/schedule/week1/</guid><description>WEEK 1 (REMOTE) Tue 1/25 Studio IN CLASS Introductions (Sophie and Eric) Fill out the Questionnaire Group Agreement Review Syllabus Intro: Reading assignments sign up Begin Unit 1: Intx with the Internet Exercise: Slack Avatar AFTER CLASS READ + WATCH
