Core Interaction comprises two courses, taken concurrently: studio and lab. Together, they form the foundation for interaction design and practice on the web. 

**Studio** meets twice a week and will provide a thorough and elaborate study of interactive concepts and techniques for applications. We will conduct an extensive investigation into the interface, mechanism, controls, and aims of interactive works. Students will learn how to design and develop complex interactive projects, undertaking comprehensive research and directing their thinking process from brainstorming to final outcome. This class will provide students with the tools to conceive, plan, and develop an interactive system, and they will become aware of the importance of their role in the development of interactive media.

**Lab** meets once a week and will focus on providing a technical and historical background to web development and the internet. The assignments are built to work in tandem with the projects students are developing in the studio class while reinforcing concepts taught in class. The lab is designed around a series of small workshops that teach beginning and intermediate interaction design through a hands-on engagement with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and software engineering.

Studio is divided into workshops, readings, as well as in-class, group and individual crits. There is an emphasis on critical thinking, research, process, craft, and risk taking. Lab will focus on historical lectures and technical instruction, focusing on front-end software development (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and the context in which we operate as practitioners. 

The ideas and concepts being taught in Studio and Lab are meant to complement each other. Certain class projects, critiques, and assessable tasks will thus exist across both classes, and their output will be evaluated jointly.

All CD classes adhere to the same [program and university policies](https://bit.ly/2LHztsW) in addition to the ones outlined in this syllabus.

By the end of the semester, students will be able to:
* Use a basic vocabulary of interactive media to both give and respond to critique productively.
* Create compelling interactive experiences through more careful and inspired interpretation/translation of content (i.e. develop great design concepts).
* Demonstrate an understanding of the iterative making process in interaction design, using incremental methods such as prototyping, user research and evaluation to build toward more advanced work.
* Conceptualize a product, object, or experience for the web and realize it through coding (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
* Evaluate the difference in designing interfaces for different kinds of devices, their limitations and specific user situations including responsive websites and apps for mobile.
* Evaluate how typography and its variables are applied to interactive systems to facilitate orientation, support usability and create consistency.
* Research historic and current design precedents to contextualize your own work.
* Be able to archive and document work that is printed, on screen or time based in a reflective manner for learning portfolio.
* Combine your artistic creativity with technology related to the internet, understanding its history and the tooling necessary to work in web environments today..
* Demonstrate a comprehension of skills, methods, techniques and processes to realize interactive systems, particularly systems for dealing with unpredictable, variable, and ever-changing content.
