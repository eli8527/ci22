Core Interaction comprises of two courses, taken concurrently: studio and lab. 

**Interaction Studio** meets twice a week and will provide a thorough and elaborate study of interactive concepts and techniques for applications. We will conduct an extensive investigation into the interface, mechanism, controls, and aims of interactive works. Students will learn how to design and develop complex interactive projects, undertaking comprehensive research and directing their thinking process from brainstorming to final outcome. This course will provide students with the tools to conceive, plan, and develop an interactive system, and they will become aware of the importance of their role in the development of interactive media.

**Interaction Lab** meets once a week and will focus on providing a technical and historical background to web development and the internet.  The assignments are built to work in tandem with the projects students are developing in the studio class while reinforcing concepts taught in class. The lab is designed around a series of small workshops that teach beginning and intermediate interaction design through a hands-on engagement with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and software engineering.
