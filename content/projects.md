## Lab Assignments
A1: Semantics are everything
Create an HTML page featuring a collection of text (eg a set of quotes, street names near you, directions from A to B, elements of typographic style, good [email sign-offs](https://www.are.na/meg-miller/good-sign-offs), a list of spam texts you've gotten). You are only allowed to use HTML tags to accomplish your layout. And you must use at least 6 different tags. Document what each tag does in HTML comments above the tag, and include a line on your page about why you selected that collection and how it all ties together.

By beginning of next class, upload this page to GitHub Pages.

A2: Garden
Using CSS and HTML, create your own digital garden. There should be at least 4 distinct elements of your garden in the browser. Using pseudo class selectors, some of these elements should do something when interacted with.

By beginning of next class, upload this page to GitHub Pages and link to it from your homepage.

A3: It’s all about type
Switch collections of text from A1 with a partner. Using the text as content, design and layout a web page to house that collection of text. Use what we’ve learned so far about HTML elements and CSS. This design should be responsive and offer different design interactions depending on desktop/mobile/print.

A4: Garden of forking paths
Revisiting your garden from A2, change it up, spruce it up, etc. by introducing animation and other behavior. You should incorporate at least one behavior based on a click event in JavaScript. Due in 2 weeks.

A5: Farewell, World
Create the last page of the internet. Using Javascript interactions, the page should dynamically unfold and tell the story, rise, fall, and collapse of the internet. This can be done visually, textually, or conceptually. It should be able to communicate some story to whoever may see it. Due 4/8.

A6: Ambient
Create an ambient website. It should be able to communicate something about itself when viewed at any given moment in time. It should make use of a data feed and incorporate everything you’ve learned so far about web programming. Due 5/13.
